## Intro

Replace all csv import/export functionnalities by Excel.
Excel support is provided by PHPSpreadsheet.

These changes apply automatically to SecurityAdmin and ModelAdmin through extension.

To make import easier, import specs are replaced by a sample file that is ready to use for the user.

## Configure exported fields

All fields are exported by default (not just summary fields that are useless by themselves)

If you want to restrict the fields, you can either:

- Implement a exportedFields method on your model that should return an array of fields
- Define a exported_fields config field on your model that will restrict the list to these fields
- Define a unexported_fields config field on your model that will blacklist these fields from being exported

## Migrate your old code

Previous version was using PHPExcel. This version use PHPSpreadhsheet. Any code using PHPExcel should
be migrated.
You can find the following guide helpful: https://phpspreadsheet.readthedocs.io/en/develop/topics/migration-from-PHPExcel/
